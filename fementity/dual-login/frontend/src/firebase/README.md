## Development API Keys
Can be found in .env


## Production API Keys
Need to set them up in another .env.production file, but it is not necessary right now


## Notes
Using .env file, or maybe .env.local file for development. It is ignored by git
Need to have separate files for both environments, but I don't want to break anything right now.
